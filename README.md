# NC News Front End Project

## About the Project


This is a small news website designed to work with [back end project](https://solveiga-nc-news-be.herokuapp.com/api) I built earlier on (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/solveigag/BE-NC-News-project)). All users can view articles and comments. Articles can be up or down voted by all users. Furthermore, articles can be viewed by topic, as well as sorted by available options and ordered in ascending or descending order. Additionally signed in users can leave comments and delete comments they have created.

You can view NC News [here](https://sols-nc-news.netlify.app).
